# Computer-Booking
A booking program to organize school computers:

This program allows staff members to access and book computer labs and/or chromebook carts.
The UI includes a browsing window to allow the user to see what days the computers are available,
as well as a booking interface to allow the user to specify exactly which period they would like to book,
which day, which computer, which teacher is booking the computer, and how many consecutive periods the teacher wants to book
There is a hard-coded limit to prevent any teacher from booking the same computer for more than three days a week in the same period,
which has been put in place to ensure every teacher/staff member has the opportinuty to book computers out for their class.
